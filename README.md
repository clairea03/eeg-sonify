# Neural Data Sonification Platform

## Project Vision

The Neural Data Sonification Platform will be an interactive Python-based tool designed to transform neural and biomedical data into sound. This project aims to create a new way for researchers to explore complex datasets by engaging both visual and auditory senses, potentially revealing patterns that might remain hidden in traditional analysis methods.

> **Note**: This project is currently in the planning phase. This README outlines the vision and planned features, which may evolve as development progresses.

## Planned Features

- **Data Import**: Support for common neural data formats (EEG, MEG) and generic time series data
- **Sonification Engine**: Multiple methods to convert data into meaningful sound
- **Interactive UI**: A Streamlit-based interface for real-time parameter adjustments
- **Synchronized Visualizations**: See what you hear with time-aligned visualizations
- **Analysis Tools**: Statistical correlations between audio features and data patterns
- **Export Options**: Save sonifications and visualizations for research presentations

## Planned Technology Stack

- **Core Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, MNE-Python
- **Audio Generation**: Librosa, PyAudio
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib
